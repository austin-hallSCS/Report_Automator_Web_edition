Working on turning the "Report Automator" script into a web app, will probably be integrated into Emilio's tech intranet

Things it can do now:
- Users can upload a report .xlsx file, it will format it and add the devices listed on it to a table in the DB. Each school has it's own DB
- Auto-Add warranty dates based on the Dell Key
- Show a table of devices from the specific school's table.
